## Implementation Plan for Key Validity Checker in migrateI18n.ts

### Overview
Add a key validity checker to the migrateI18n.ts script that verifies if the keys to be migrated already exist in the source JSON file, and throws an error if any do.

### Steps

1. **Add File System Import**
   - Import `fs` module for reading source JSON files

2. **Add Key Check Step**
   - Insert a new step after running `getWebKeyValue.ts` to check for existing keys
   - Determine source JSON path based on project type:
     - Trade: Use `TRADE_PROJECT_JSON` from .env
     - Pages: Use `PAGES_PROJECT_JSON` from .env

3. **Read Source JSON**
   - Validate that the source JSON file exists
   - Read and parse the source JSON file

4. **Collect Keys to Migrate**
   - Dynamically import `valuesByLocale` after running `getWebKeyValue.ts`
   - Collect all unique keys from the `valuesByLocale` object

5. **Check for Existing Keys**
   - Compare each key to be migrated against the source JSON
   - Collect any keys that already exist

6. **Handle Existing Keys**
   - If any existing keys are found, throw an error with the list of existing keys
   - Otherwise, proceed with the migration

7. **Add Error Handling**
   - Handle missing environment variables
   - Handle missing or invalid source JSON files
   - Handle any other errors that might occur during the check

### Expected Behavior
- If no existing keys are found, the migration proceeds as normal
- If existing keys are found, the script throws an error and stops the process
- Clear, informative error messages are provided to the user

This implementation will prevent accidentally overwriting existing translations and ensure that only new keys are migrated.
